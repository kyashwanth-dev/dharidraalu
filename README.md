# 🪐 Life on Hard Mode™  
### (ShaniDev Premium User)

Welcome to the only GitHub repository where  
**the bugs are not in the code — they’re in destiny.**

I am currently running on:

> 🐍 **Shani Dev 7-Year Premium Unfate Plan™**  
> No refunds. No retries. No luck.

This repo is the **version-controlled evidence** of how reality keeps throwing  
`404: Happiness Not Found`

## 🧬 What is this?

This is a **daily, brutally honest log** of:

- 💥 Failures  
- 🧱 Roadblocks  
- ⏳ Delays  
- 🪤 Traps  
- 🎯 Almost-successes that still failed  
- 🐞 Bugs in life itself  

Written in Markdown.  
Committed to Git.  
Stamped by fate.

## 🤖 Why GitHub?

Because:
- 🧠 Memory is unreliable  
- 🗣 People gaslight  
- 🧾 GitHub gives receipts  

If life keeps saying *“trust me bro”*,  
I respond with **`git commit -m "another disaster"`**

## 📁 How this repo works

Every day = one file.


Each file contains:

Not that I’m unlucky.

But that I am:
> **Statistically, consistently, professionally cursed.**

This is not chaos.  
This is a **pattern**.

## 🛑 Disclaimer

This is not for sympathy.

I will at least **log the errors.**
