# dharidralu (धरिद्रलु) - My Daily Diary of Unlucky Incidents 😢

This repository is my daily diary where I commit daily entries describing the unlucky incidents of my day.

## Purpose
Life isn't always sunshine and rainbows. This is a personal space to document, reflect on, and maybe even laugh at the small (and sometimes big) unlucky moments that happen in daily life.

## Structure
- `diary/YYYY/MM/` - Diary entries organized by year and month
- `TEMPLATE.md` - Template for creating new diary entries

## How to Add a New Entry

1. Copy the `TEMPLATE.md` file
2. Create a new file in the appropriate `diary/YYYY/MM/` directory
3. Name the file with the date: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
4. Fill in your unlucky incidents for the day
5. Commit and push your entry

Example:
```bash
cp TEMPLATE.md diary/2026/01/2026-01-22.md
# Edit the file with your incidents
git add diary/2026/01/2026-01-22.md
git commit -m "Daily entry: 2026-01-22"
git push
```

## Sample Entry
Check out `diary/2026/01/2026-01-22.md` for an example of how to format your entries.

## Why "dharidralu"?
"Dharidralu" (ధరిద్రలు) is a Telugu word that roughly translates to "unfortunate incidents" or "troubles" - a fitting name for this repository of daily misfortunes!

*Remember: Every unlucky day is just a story waiting to be told. Tomorrow is a new day! 🌅*
