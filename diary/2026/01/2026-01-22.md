## Today's Unlucky Incidents 😢

### Incident 1: Spilled Coffee on My Keyboard
- **What happened:** Was carrying my morning coffee while checking notifications and accidentally knocked it over onto my keyboard.
- **Why it was unlucky:** Had to spend the morning cleaning and drying the keyboard instead of working on my project.
- **Lesson learned (if any):** Keep beverages away from electronics, especially in the morning when I'm still half asleep!

### Incident 2: Missed the Bus by 30 Seconds
- **What happened:** Ran to the bus stop only to watch the bus pull away just as I arrived.
- **Why it was unlucky:** Had to wait 30 minutes for the next one and was late to an important meeting.
- **Lesson learned (if any):** Should leave 5 minutes earlier to have a buffer.
